        "### 1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to efficiently perform operations such as access, insertion, deletion, and updating. They are important because they help in optimizing performance for various operations depending on the task. Examples include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "- **Mutable data types**: These can be modified after creation. Example: `list`, `dict`, `set`.\n",
        "- **Immutable data types**: These cannot be modified after creation. Example: `tuple`, `str`, `frozenset`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "- **Lists**: Mutable, can be modified after creation (add, remove, or update elements).\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Immutable, cannot be modified after creation (cannot change, add, or remove elements).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and the value associated with a key can be any data type. They use hashing to store data, allowing for fast lookup times.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "You would use a set instead of a list when you need to:\n",
        "- Ensure all elements are unique (no duplicates).\n",
        "- Check membership or perform set operations like union, intersection, or difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "A **string** is a sequence of characters, while a **list** is a collection of ordered elements which can be of any data type. A string is immutable, meaning you cannot modify individual characters, while a list is mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "Tuples ensure data integrity by being immutable. Once created, the elements cannot be changed, added, or removed, preventing accidental modification of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "A **hash table** is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, allowing for fast retrieval of values based on their keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "Yes, lists in Python can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, or even other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "Strings are immutable in Python to improve performance, memory management, and to prevent accidental modification of data that could lead to bugs or inconsistent states in the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "Dictionaries offer faster lookups for specific keys, whereas lists require searching through all elements. If you need to associate a key with a value, dictionaries are more efficient for data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "Sets automatically remove duplicate values. If you attempt to add a duplicate value to a set, it will not be included.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "Tuples are preferable when the data should not be modified after creation. For example, when representing fixed collections like coordinates or RGB color values, where the integrity of the data is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "- In **lists**, the “in” keyword checks if a specific value is present in the list.\n",
        "- In **dictionaries**, the “in” keyword checks if a specific key exists in the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable, meaning their data cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains other dictionaries as its values. Example: A use case could be a contact book where each person has a dictionary of contact details (address, phone number, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "contacts = {\n",
        "    'Alice': {'phone': '1234', 'address': 'Street 1'},\n",
        "    'Bob': {'phone': '5678', 'address': 'Street 2'}\n",
        "}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "The time complexity for accessing elements in a dictionary is **O(1)** on average, due to the use of hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "Lists are preferred when you need to maintain an ordered collection or when you need to perform operations like sorting or indexing based on position, rather than using keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "Dictionaries are considered unordered because the keys do not have a specific order. This means when you iterate through the dictionary, the order of elements may not be consistent. However, key-based retrieval is fast (constant time complexity).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "- **Lists**: You retrieve data by index (position).\n",
        "- **Dictionaries**: You retrieve data by key (not position).\n",
        "\n",
