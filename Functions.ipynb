        "#### 1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "- **Function**: A function is a block of code that is defined once and can be called by name to perform a specific task. It is not bound to any object.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    def add(a, b):\n",
        "        return a + b\n",
        "    print(add(5, 10))  # Output: 15\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "- **Method**: A method is a function that is associated with an object. It is called on the object, and it can modify or access the object's attributes.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    class Calculator:\n",
        "        def add(self, a, b):\n",
        "            return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "    calc = Calculator()\n",
        "    print(calc.add(5, 10))  # Output: 15\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "- **Parameters**: These are variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.\n",
        "- **Arguments**: These are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\")  # \"Alice\" is an argument\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "- **Defining a function**: Use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parameters.\n",
        "- **Calling a function**: Use the function name followed by parentheses with arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "greet(\"John\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "The `return` statement is used to exit the function and optionally return a value to the caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add(5, 3)  # result will be 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "- **Iterator**: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It implements the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. You can iterate through an iterator using a loop.\n",
        "- **Iterable**: An iterable is any object that can return an iterator using the `__iter__()` method, such as lists, tuples, or strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of an iterator:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "iterator = iter(nums)  # Create an iterator from the list\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "- **Generators** are a special type of iterator that allow lazy evaluation. They are defined using the `yield` keyword and can generate items on the fly without storing them in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def count_up_to(n):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= n:\n",
        "        yield count\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(3)\n",
        "for num in counter:\n",
        "    print(num)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "- **Memory Efficiency**: Generators yield items one at a time and do not store them in memory, making them more memory-efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "- **Lazy Evaluation**: They calculate values as needed instead of all at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "A **lambda function** is an anonymous function that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. It is used for short, throwaway functions where a full function definition is unnecessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an iterable (such as a list) and returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
        "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "- **`map()`**: Applies a function to every item in an iterable and returns a new iterable.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    map(func, iterable)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "- **`reduce()`**: Applies a binary function (two arguments) cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    from functools import reduce\n",
        "    reduce(func, iterable)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "- **`filter()`**: Filters items in an iterable based on a condition defined in a function.\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    filter(func, iterable)\n",
        "    ```\n",
