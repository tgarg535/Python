        "### 1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. For example, a `Car` class might have attributes like `color` and `speed`, and methods like `accelerate()` and `brake()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "An **object** is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created from the class blueprint, with its own set of attributes and behaviors. For example, if `Car` is a class, then `my_car = Car()` creates an object `my_car` of the `Car` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. For example, a `Car` class might expose a `start()` method without revealing how the engine works internally.\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is often achieved using access modifiers like private or protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores, e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`. They define how objects behave in certain situations, such as initialization, string representation, or arithmetic operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "**Inheritance** allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "dog.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "**Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to behave differently based on the object calling them. For example, a `speak()` method might produce different outputs for `Dog` and `Cat` objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved in Python using:\n",
        "- **Private attributes**: Prefixing attribute names with `_` or `__` (e.g., `__name`).\n",
        "- **Getter and setter methods**: Using methods to access or modify private attributes.\n",
        "- **Property decorators**: Using `@property` to control access to attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "A **constructor** is a special method (`__init__`) in a class that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
        "        self.color = color\n",
        "\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "- **Class method**: A method bound to the class rather than the instance. It takes `cls` as the first parameter and is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
        "- **Static method**: A method that does not depend on the class or instance. It is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and does not take `self` or `cls` as parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. **What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "Python does not support method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) directly. However, you can achieve similar functionality using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "**Method overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "The `@property` decorator allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute. It is often used to create getters, setters, and deleters for private attributes. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Circle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "        self._radius = radius\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def radius(self):\n",
        "        return self._radius\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "Polymorphism allows for flexible and reusable code. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types), making it easier to extend and maintain code.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It often contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation). Abstract classes are created using the `abc` module. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "- **Modularity**: Code is organized into reusable components.\n",
        "- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across programs.\n",
        "- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug.\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Easier to extend and add new features.\n",
        "- **Abstraction**: Simplifies complex systems by hiding details.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "**Multiple inheritance** allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "class B:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "- **Class variable**: Shared across all instances of a class. Defined outside any method.\n",
        "- **Instance variable**: Unique to each instance of a class. Defined inside the `__init__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.**\n",
        "- `__str__`: Provides a user-friendly string representation of an object, used by `print()` and `str()`.\n",
        "- `__repr__`: Provides an unambiguous string representation of an object, used for debugging and development.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**\n",
        "The `super()` function is used to call a method from the parent class. It is often used in inheritance to extend or override parent class functionality. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",

        "\n",
        "### 21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "The `__del__` method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to perform cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. **What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**\n",
        "- `@staticmethod`: Does not take `self` or `cls` as parameters. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.\n",
        "- `@classmethod`: Takes `cls` as the first parameter and can access or modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python allows a subclass to override a method from its superclass. When the method is called, the version in the subclass is executed. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",

        "### 24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "**Method chaining** is a technique where multiple methods are called on an object in a single statement. Each method returns the object itself (`self`), allowing the calls to be chained. For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
