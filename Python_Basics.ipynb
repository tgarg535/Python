        "### 1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax, ease of learning, and wide range of applications. It is popular due to:\n",
        "- **Simplicity**: The syntax is easy to read and write, which makes it beginner-friendly.\n",
        "- **Versatility**: Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, scripting, and more.\n",
        "- **Large community and libraries**: It has an extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Django, and TensorFlow.\n",
        "- **Cross-platform compatibility**: It can run on various platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "An **interpreter** is a program that reads and executes code line by line. In Python, the interpreter translates Python code into machine code, enabling the program to run without the need for a separate compilation step. This is different from compiled languages, where code is first converted into machine code before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "**Keywords** are reserved words in Python that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. Examples include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `return`, `class`, etc. They are part of the syntax of Python and help control the flow and behavior of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "No, **keywords** cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved for specific syntax and functionality within the language. Using them as variable names would cause a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "**Mutability** refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created. Mutable objects can have their values altered, while immutable objects cannot be modified after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- **Lists** are mutable because they are designed to allow changes in their content, such as adding or removing elements, which is useful in many scenarios.\n",
        "- **Tuples** are immutable to offer more security and performance optimization, especially in situations where constant values need to be stored. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "- `==`: Compares the **values** of two objects to see if they are equal.\n",
        "- `is`: Compares the **identity** (memory location) of two objects to see if they refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. These include:\n",
        "- **and**: Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "- **or**: Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "- **not**: Reverses the logical state of its operand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "**Type casting** is the process of converting one data type to another. In Python, it can be done explicitly (manual conversion) or implicitly (automatically by Python).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- **Implicit type casting** (or coercion) is automatically done by Python when it converts a smaller data type to a larger one, such as converting an `int` to a `float` when necessary.\n",
        "- **Explicit type casting** is when the programmer manually converts a data type using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Conditional statements in Python, like `if`, `elif`, and `else`, allow you to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. They execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "The `elif` (short for \"else if\") statement is used to check multiple conditions. If the initial `if` condition is false, the `elif` condition is evaluated. If it is true, the corresponding code block is executed. If no `if` or `elif` conditions are true, the `else` block is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- **For loop**: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) and executes a block of code for each item.\n",
        "- **While loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "A **while loop** is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a dynamic condition. For example, in a situation where you are waiting for user input until a valid value is provided, you can use a `while` loop to continue prompting the user until the condition is met:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "user_input = \"\"\n",
        "while user_input != \"yes\":\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Do you want to continue? (yes/no): \")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the loop continues until the user explicitly types \"yes,\" which is more flexible than using a `for` loop with a fixed range."
