        "### 1. **Difference between interpreted and compiled languages:**\n",
        "   - **Interpreted languages:** These languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter. Python is an interpreted language, meaning the code is translated into machine code at runtime, which makes it slower compared to compiled languages. Example: Python, JavaScript.\n",
        "   - **Compiled languages:** In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. This results in faster execution but requires an extra compilation step before running the program. Example: C, C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "   Exception handling in Python refers to the process of dealing with runtime errors (exceptions) in a controlled way, using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. This ensures that your program can continue to run even when something goes wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **What is the purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "   The `finally` block is used to define cleanup actions that need to happen regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It will always execute after the `try` and `except` blocks, even if an exception is not raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       x = 10 / 0\n",
        "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       print(\"Can't divide by zero!\")\n",
        "   finally:\n",
        "       print(\"This will always run!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "   Logging in Python is a way of recording events or messages in a program, especially for debugging or tracking program execution. It provides different levels of messages like debug, info, warning, error, and critical. Python's `logging` module is used to log messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "   The `__del__` method is the destructor method in Python, used to perform cleanup when an object is about to be destroyed (usually when it is no longer in use). It is called when an object is garbage collected, but its usage is rare because Python has automatic memory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **What is the difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python?**\n",
        "   - `import`: Imports the entire module, and you access its functions or classes using the module name (e.g., `module.function()`).\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     import math\n",
        "     print(math.sqrt(16))\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - `from ... import`: Imports specific functions or variables from a module directly, so you donâ€™t need to use the module name when accessing them.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     from math import sqrt\n",
        "     print(sqrt(16))\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "   You can handle multiple exceptions by chaining multiple `except` blocks or using a tuple of exceptions.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       # Some code\n",
        "   except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n",
        "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "   The `with` statement simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file when the block is done, even if an exception occurs within the block. This ensures that file resources are properly released.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
        "       content = file.read()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "   - **Multithreading:** Involves running multiple threads (lightweight processes) within a single process. Threads share the same memory space, which allows for fast communication but can lead to issues like race conditions.\n",
        "   - **Multiprocessing:** Involves running multiple processes with separate memory spaces. It is better suited for CPU-bound tasks because each process can run independently and take advantage of multiple CPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "   - Helps track errors, warnings, or important events.\n",
        "   - Allows for better debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
        "   - Can be configured to log messages at different levels (e.g., info, error).\n",
        "   - Can log messages to files, streams, or external services, which is helpful for long-term monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. **What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "   Memory management in Python is handled by the Python memory manager, which uses techniques like reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. **What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "   The basic steps in exception handling are:\n",
        "   - **Try block:** Code that might raise an exception is placed in the `try` block.\n",
        "   - **Except block:** If an exception occurs, it is caught in the `except` block.\n",
        "   - **Else block:** If no exception occurs, the `else` block can be executed.\n",
        "   - **Finally block:** Cleanup code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. **Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "   Memory management is crucial in Python to avoid memory leaks, optimize performance, and ensure that memory is freed when it is no longer needed. This prevents your program from consuming excessive memory and potentially crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. **What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "   - **`try`:** Contains code that may potentially raise an exception.\n",
        "   - **`except`:** Catches and handles the exception if it occurs. You can specify the type of exception to catch, or catch all exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
        "   except SomeException:\n",
        "       # Code to handle the exception\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. **How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "   Python uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory. The most common method is **reference counting**, where objects are automatically destroyed when their reference count drops to zero. It also uses **cyclic garbage collection** to detect and clean up objects involved in circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. **What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "   The `else` block is used to define code that runs only if no exception was raised in the `try` block. It's useful for code that should only execute when no errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       x = 5 / 1\n",
        "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       print(\"Division by zero!\")\n",
        "   else:\n",
        "       print(\"No exceptions occurred!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. **What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "   The common logging levels are:\n",
        "   - `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
        "   - `INFO`: General information about program execution.\n",
        "   - `WARNING`: An indication that something unexpected happened, but the program is still working.\n",
        "   - `ERROR`: A more serious issue, indicating the program cannot perform a specific task.\n",
        "   - `CRITICAL`: A very serious issue, indicating the program may not be able to continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. **What is the difference between `os.fork()` and `multiprocessing` in Python?**\n",
        "   - **`os.fork()`:** It is a Unix-based system call used to create a child process. The parent and child processes share the same memory space.\n",
        "   - **`multiprocessing`:** A Python module that provides a higher-level API for creating and managing processes. Each process has its own memory space, making it better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. **What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "   Closing a file ensures that all resources associated with the file are released. It also ensures that changes to the file are saved, and file descriptors are freed, preventing memory leaks or other issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. **What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**\n",
        "   - **`file.read()`:** Reads the entire contents of a file as a single string.\n",
        "   - **`file.readline()`:** Reads the next line from the file each time it's called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. **What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "   The `logging` module in Python is used to log messages from your program, such as debugging information, warnings, errors, or general status messages. It allows you to log to different destinations, such as files, the console, or external systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. **What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "   The `os` module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as working with file paths, reading and writing files, creating directories, and removing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. **What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "   Some challenges include:\n",
        "   - Handling circular references.\n",
        "   - Managing large objects that are not properly freed.\n",
        "   - Dealing with memory leaks due to improperly managed resources or libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. **How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "   You can raise an exception manually using the `raise` keyword.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   raise ValueError(\"An error occurred!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 25. **Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "   Multithreading allows an application to run multiple tasks concurrently in the same process, making it ideal for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., web requests, file operations). It helps improve the efficiency of programs that spend a lot of time waiting for external resources.\n",
